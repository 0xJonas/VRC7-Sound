# VRC7-Sound

Emulator for the expansion sound of the Konami VRC7.

## About

VRC7-Sound is an open-source emulator for the Konami VRC7's expansion sound, featured in the Famicom game *Lagrange Point*.
The VRC7 enables FM-style music through the use of a modified Yamaha YM2413 (OPLL) architecture, which is itself based on the
YM3812, a chip prominently used in the AdLib and Sound Blaster soundcards. The emulator attempts to accurately recreate this sound
by relying mostly on information gathered from the VRC7's die shot.

## Usage

To use VRC7-Sound, simply embed the source files into your C/C++ project. No additional libraries are required. Detailed 
description of how to use the emulator and it's specific functions are given in the header file (vrc7_sound.h).
